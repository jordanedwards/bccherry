                                <h4>TYPICAL HOURS OF WORK:</h4>
                                <p>Picking crews generally work from sunrise until noon, depending on the heat.
                                    Packinghouse shifts generally start an hour or two later and run for 8 or 9 hours.
                                    Some orchards may run two shifts or picking crews come in after picking to do a
                                    short shift in the afternoon.<br>
                                <h4>WAGES:</p>
                                <p>Wages vary from orchard to orchard but there is a minimum picking piecework rate of
                                    (2013) $2.24 per pail, including holiday pay. Packinghouse wages usually depend on
                                    experience and skill, most paying well above minimum wage for hourly jobs. Some
                                    packinghouses offer piecework pay systems for sorting.</p>

                                    keep “lists” from year to year so be sure to make your contacts early with the
                                    individual orchardist. A few of the larger farms have their own linked websites to
                                    provide more details as to what to expect. Many growers have on-site camping
                                    facilities for their workers.</p>
