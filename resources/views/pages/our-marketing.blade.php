                                BC is on Canada's west coast. The cherry growing regions of BC include 3 valleys with
                                warm, dry climates: Okanagan, Similkameen, and Creston. The majority of the varieties
                                grown here were bred in Summerland, BC. Some popular Summerland varieties include
                                Lapins, Sweetheart, Skeena, Staccato™, and Sentennial™.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                All cherries are harvested by hand. They are cooled, sorted, and packed at locally owned
                                and operated packing houses that meet stringent regulatory and certification standards.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Cherries are shipped domestically and exported internationally. The Port of Vancouver
                                and the Vancouver International Airport are just a few short hours away. Fruit also goes
                                by air from Calgary and Edmonton, and by sea from Montreal.
                            </p>

                                Canada has trade agreements with many countries, however we don't have market access to
                                all of these nations. We are currently working with the Canadian Government towards
                                exports to South Korea and Japan. In 2014 we formalized an agreement to allow exports to
                                the People's Republic of China. All destination countries have different import
                                regulations; these can be discussed with your sales agent.
