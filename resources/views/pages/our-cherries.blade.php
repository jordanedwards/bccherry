                            <p><span class="red-intro">All our “S” cherries were bred by the Agri-Food Research Centre (PARC) in Summerland, BC, Canada. They are specially suited to the pristine northern growing area of the Okanagan, Similkameen and Creston Valley in British Columbia. The hot dry summer days and crisp, cool nights provided by lake&nbsp;and mountain breezes produce excellent, large and very firm cherries, with excellent shipping and shelf-life characteristics – gaining a reputation for fine premium quality fruit in over 20 countries.&nbsp;</span>
