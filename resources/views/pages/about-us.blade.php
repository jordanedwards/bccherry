                    <div class="pf-content"><p>Formerly called the Okanagan Kootenay Cherry Growers' Association
                            (OKCGA), the organization was formed in 1998 by a small group of cherry growers seeking to
                            pool financial resources to increase research and development of cherry production in the
                            region. Through a voluntary contribution of a penny per pound from each grower, significant
                            gains have been made - not just in research, but in other areas, such as minor use pesticide
                            registration, orchard and employment issues, and forums for growers. Since inception, annual
                            grower contributions, partnered with provincial and federal programs, have enabled five or
                            six priority research projects annually - working with the Pacific Agriculture Research
                            Centre (PARC) and other researchers and consultants.</p>
                        <p>The executive contribute many hours on other matters, such as chemical registration,
                            communication of horticultural information, field days and forums. In recent years the
                            organization has broadened it scope to address trade and market access and development
                            issues - to keep ahead of the major increases in production. The Board has two major
                            committees - Research and Development, and Market Access and Promotion. Each of these
                            committees includes growers and other specialists and industry stakeholders - providing the
                            experience and knowledge to prioritize the issues and guide the work to be done.</p>
                        <p>Other services to members include an online horticultural forum, orchard listings for
                            employment, classified advertising, and marketing directory to help buyers of all kinds find
                            the fruit they are looking for.</p>
                        <p>Growers are strongly urged to join and contribute the annual research levy to enable the BCCA
                            to do even more work in the future. Print out and mail in the attached membershipform.</p>
