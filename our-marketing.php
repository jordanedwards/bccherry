	<p><span class="red-intro">The BCCA works with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and the BC Ministry of Agriculture to administer export programs. We also act as the industry body when negotiating market access for new cherry export deals.</span></p>

	<p>
BC is on Canada's west coast. The cherry growing regions of BC include 3 valleys with warm, dry climates:  Okanagan,  Similkameen, and Creston. The majority of the varieties grown here were bred in Summerland, BC. Some popular Summerland varieties include Lapins, Sweetheart, Skeena, Staccato™, and Sentennial™. 
	</p>

	<p>
All cherries are harvested by hand. They are cooled, sorted, and packed at locally owned and operated packing houses that meet stringent regulatory and certification standards.
	</p>

<p>
Cherries are shipped domestically and exported internationally. The Port of Vancouver and the Vancouver International Airport are just a few short hours away. Fruit also goes by air from Calgary and Edmonton, and by sea from Montreal.
</p>

<p>
Canada has trade agreements with many countries, however we don't have market access to all of these nations. We are currently working with the Canadian Government towards exports to South Korea and Japan. In 2014 we formalized an agreement to allow exports to the People's Republic of China. All destination countries have different import regulations; these can be discussed with your sales agent.
